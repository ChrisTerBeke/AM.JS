## Issue and pull request templates
Please follow the given templates for issue and pull request creation.
These help us processes issues and pull requests faster.
Issues or pull requests without these templates will still be looked at, but might take longer to process.

## Code style
We want to keep the AM.JS codebase clean.
We try to be as object oriented as possible.
Code style is enforced by `tslint` and checked in the CI process.
For typing we use TypeScript, which allows for a very powerful development workflow in most IDEs.
Unit tests are great, but not every obvious method has to be unit-tested.
Rather focus on feature testing to see if an entire API method breaks when making changes.
This should give the same or even higher code coverage.

## Branches
Please submit your contributions via a pull request on the `master` branch.
