# AM.JS
A fast and fully-featured previewing library for 3D printing.

## Introduction
The goal of AM.JS is to create a modern, fast and fully-featured WebGL library for 3D printing.
The focus is on previewing STL and G-code files. Later on more file types and features will be added.

## Development
We want to keep the AM.JS clean. For typing we use TypeScript, which allows for a very powerful development workflow
in most IDEs. We try to be as object oriented as possible.
